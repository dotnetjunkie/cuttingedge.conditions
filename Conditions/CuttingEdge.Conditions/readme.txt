This project contains the CuttingEdge.Conditions library. It enables developers to validate pre- and 
postconditions in a fluent manner. Following blogposts describe more about the library:

Below are some notes on the implementation specially for developers.

Notes:
	Coding style:
		Microsoft StyleCop is used as tool to ensure a consistant coding style throughout the library.
		The project has a Settings.SourceAnalysis xml file containing the settings for StyleCop. You can 
		download StyleCop from http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/sourceanalysis. It will integrate in Visual 
		Studio and you can validate your code by pressing Ctrl-Shift-Y. Also check out the great StyleCop
		For Resharper plugin at http://www.codeplex.com/StyleCopForReSharper.
		
	Framework Design Guidelines:
		Microsoft FxCop is used to validate the .NET Framework Design Guidelines. The solution folder contains
		a Conditions.FxCop xml file containing the settings for FxCop. It is integrated with Visual Studio
		Team System, but you can download the stand allone version of FxCop from
		http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9aeaa970-f281-4fb0-aba1-d59d7ed09772.

	Generic type constraint:
		All compare methods implement the generic type constraint 'where T : IComparable'. While the 
		constraint is not needed for those methods to work, it will prevent the methods to show up on types
		that usually can't be prepared anyway. This helps keeping the API as clean as possible.

	Comparing Nullable<T>
		Because Nullable<T> doesn't implement IComparable there are special overloads of all the compare
		methods that have a Validator<Nullable<T>> validator argument.

Optimizations:
	New in the beta 2 release are a lot of overloads for primitive types (like, int, double, etc). While
	they won't enrich the API, they will improve performance cases where those primitive types are used
	in compare validations. The primitive overloads are much faster than the generic 'where T : ICompare'
	compare methods.	
	
	While the beta 1 release tried to optimize the library in such a way that many methods could become a
	candidate for inlining, this had no effect. The comments and unit tests that indicate that methods could
	be inlinable are removed from the beta 2 release.
