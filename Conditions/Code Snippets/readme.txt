This folder contains code snippets for C# and VB. They allow you to speed up validation using the CuttingEdge.Conditions library. Copy the contents of this folder to your "[my documents]\Visual Studio 2008\Code Snippets" folder. After that you can use the snippets by simply typing "requires[tab][tab]" or "ensures[tab][tab]".

Have fun!
